Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided one
by one
var employee1 = {firstName: 'John'
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy'
, lastName: 'Rodson'};
, lastName: 'Baily'};
function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ '

invite.call(employee2,
'Hello'
'Hello'
,
,
'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?

bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments
var employee1 = {firstName: 'John'
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy'
, lastName: 'Rodson'};
, lastName: 'Baily'};
function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ '
,
'+ greeting2);
}
var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1('Hello'
,
'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2('Hello'
,
'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You
need to decide whether itâ€™s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments.
You can remember by treating Call is for comma (separated list) and Apply is for Array.
Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the first parameter passed to
bind().
